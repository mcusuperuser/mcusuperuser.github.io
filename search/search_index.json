A variable is a name that represents one or more memory locations used to hold program data. A variable is a kind of bucket that you can use to hold program data. Code example int myVar; myVar = 42; Variable declarations consist of a data type and a unique identifier (name) int myVar; char myLetter; float myFLoat, The data type determines the size of the memory location that is used to store the variable and determines how the value of the variable is interpreted. Identifiers What are identifiers? Identifiers are names that are given to program elements, such as variables, functions, arrays, or any other named element. Valid characters in identifiers are '_', 'a' to 'z', 'A' to 'Z', and '0' to '9' (not allowed for the first character). Identifiers are case sensitive, so myVar is not the same as myvar ! You must not use keywords of the C language as identifiers. The Arm compiler provides additional keywords that are extensions to the C/C++ standards and must also not be used as identifiers.

Usually, header files have the filename extension .h . To use a header file in your C code, associate it with the #include directive. The #include directive can be used in three different ways. You can: Look for a header file in the compiler include path, which contains the compiler's directory and all of its sub-directories: #include <stdio.h> Look for a file in the project directory: #include \"myHeader.h\" Look for a file using an absolute or relative path: #include \"..\\..\\myHeader2.h\" #include \"C:\\projects\\myProject\\inc\\myHeader3.h\" Code example main.h header file: int n, m, p; float myFloat; main.c source file: #include \"main.h\" int main (void) { n = 3; m = 1; p = n - m; myFLoat = 1 / p; } Using the #include directive, the contents of the main.h header file are pasted into the main.c source file, starting at the #include directive\u2019s line.

A literal is a notation for representing a fixed value in source code. A constant is a value that cannot be altered by the program during normal execution. In other words: a literal is the actual value (such as a number or character for example), that is assigned to a variable or constant. You can also use literals directly as a function parameter or as an operand in an expression. While both terms are often used interchangeably, they are not the same. A literal is a constant, but a constant is not a literal. Constants, as the name implies, never change their value which makes development changes easy and eliminates the use of \"magic numbers\". How to declare a constant There are two ways to declare a constant: #define identifierName value const type identifierName value; The identifierName is the constant, while the value is the literal. The first way is very efficient for an embedded system, as it does not consume any memory in the microcontroller. Using the #define , you declare a text substitution label, which means that each instance of identifierName will be replaced with value by the preprocessor unless identifierName is inside a string. A #define is never terminated with a ';' , unless you want that semicolon to be part of the substitution. The second way allocates a variable in program memory, but it cannot be changed due to the const keyword. While this is inefficient for normal constants, it is a good way to save lookup tables in Flash memory for example. Types of literals The Arm assembler user's guide states that \"source code can contain numeric, string, Boolean, and single character literals\". Literals can be expressed as: Decimal numbers, for example 123 . Hexadecimal numbers, for example 0x7B . Numbers in any base from 2 to 9, for example 5_204 is a number in base 5. Floating point numbers, for example 123.4 . Boolean values {TRUE} or {FALSE} . Single character values enclosed by single quotes, for example 'w' . Strings enclosed in double quotes, for example \"This is a string\" . String literals C does not have a string type. One way to store strings in C is to use arrays of characters. Later, we will learn how to use pointers to define strings. When strings are declared as character arrays, they are stored like other types of arrays in C. If you declare the string without a dimension, the null character is automatically appended to the end of the string: Code example char name[] = \"Cortex\"; This is stored as: name[0] = 'C' name[1] = 'o' name[2] = 'r' name[3] = 't' name[4] = 'e' name[5] = 'x' name[6] = '\\0' Special characters in strings Use escape sequences to include special characters in strings, just like any other ordinary character. The backslash '\\' plus the following character is considered as a single character with a single ASCII value.

In embedded systems, often a UART is used. In Arm Cortex-M based systems you can redirect the standard output to the ITM debug channel which saves resources (the UART) and is much faster. In \u00b5Vision, you can use the \"Debug printf() Viewer\" window to observe printf() messages delivered via ITM. Using the Arm C complier, it is mandatory to link your application with the standard C library, even you do not directly use C library functions. This is because the compiler might implicitly generate calls to C library functions. The standard C library consists of: - All functions defined by the ISO C99 library standard. - Target-dependent functions that implement the C library functions in the semihosted execution environment.

An arithmetic expression contains one or more operands and arithmetic operators. Operands may be variables, constants or functions that return a value. Arithmetic operators Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic/mathematical operations on operands. Arithmetic operators are of two distinct types: - Binary Operators work on two operands: +, -, *, /, % - Unary Operators work on a single operand: +, -, ++, -- Operator Operation Example Result * Multiplication a * b Product of a and b / Division a / b Quotient of a and b % Modulo a % b Remainder of a divided by b + Addition a + b Sum of a and b - Subtraction a - b Difference of a and b - (unary) Negative -a Negative value of a + (unary) Positive +a Value of a Division operator If both operands are of an integer type, the result will be an integer type as well (valid for int and char ). If one or both of the operands is a floating point type, the result will be a floating point type ( float , double ). Implicit type conversion When an expression is used in the context where a value of a different type is expected, conversion may occur. In such cases, the type of one operand will be temporarily \"promoted\" to the larger type of the other operand. This means that during an operation, the smaller data type will be promoted to the largest one in the expression. Code examples short n = -5; -n // promotion to int; result is 5 n * -3L // promotion to long, because -3L is a long; result is 15 7 / n // promotion to int; result is -1 9 % n // promotion to int; result is 4 8.0 / n // promotion to double, because 8.0 is a double; result is -1.6 Increment and decrement Increment/decrement operators are unary operators that increment/decrement the value of a given variable by 1. Operator Operation Example Result ++ Increment a++ Postfix form: use a and then add 1 ++a Prefix form: add 1 to a and then use a -- Decrement a-- Postfix form: use a and then subtract 1 --a Prefix form: subtract 1 from a and then use a Code example int n, m; n = 3; // Postfix example m = (n++) + 8; // Result: n = 4, m = 11 // Prefix example m = (++n) + 8; // Result: n = 4, m = 12 Assignment operators Assignment operators are binary operators that modify the variable to their left using the value to their right, or in other words, they assign a value to a variable. There are two types of assignment operators available: Simple assignments variable = expression The expression is evaluated and the result is assigned to the variable. Compound assignments variable = variable operator expression The variable is modified using the operator and the expression and the result is assigned to the variable. Operator Example Equivalent = a = b Assign the value of b to a += a += b a = a + b -= a -= b a = a - b *= a *= b a = a * b /= a /= b a = a / b %= a %= b a = a % b &= a &= b a = a & b \\|= a \\|= b a = a \\| b ^= a ^= b a = a ^ b <<= a <<= b a = a << b >>= a >>= b a = a >> b Relational (comparison) operators Relational operators are binary operators that test a condition and return 1 if that condition is logically true and 0 if that condition is false . Operator Operation Example Result (FALSE = 0, TRUE = 1) == Equal to a == b 1 if a equal to b , else 0 != Not equal to a != b 1 if a not equal to b , else 0 > Greater than a > b 1 if a greater than b , else 0 >= Greater than or equal to a >= b 1 if a greater than or equal to b , else 0 < Less than a < b 1 if a less than b , else 0 <= Less than or equal to a <= b 1 if a less than or equal to b , else 0 Note Do not interchange = with == . = is the assignment operator, while == is the \"equals to\" relational operator. Code example int n, m; n = 3; // assign the value 3 to a if (m == 45) { // check if m equals to 45 // do something here } Logical operators Logical operators apply standard boolean algebra operations to their operands. Operator Operation Example Result ! Logical NOT !a 1 if a = 0 , else 0 && Logical AND a && b 1 if both a \u2260 0 and b \u2260 0 , else 0 || Logical OR a || b 0 if both a = 0 and b = 0 , else 1 Bitwise operators Bitwise operators apply the operation to each bit of the first operand with each corresponding bit of the second operand. Operator Operation Example Result ~ Bitwise NOT ~a 1 , if 0 in a ; 0 , if 1 in a & Bitwise AND a & b 1 , if 1 in both a and b ; 0 , if 0 in a or b or both | Bitwise OR a | b 1 , if 1 in a or b or both; 0 , if 0 in both a and b ^ Bitwise XOR a ^ b 1 , if 1 in a or b but not both; 0 , if 0 or 1 in both a and b Note The bitwise NOT is also known as \"One's complement\". Do not interchange & with && . & is the bitwise AND operator, while && is the logical AND operator. Code example int n, m; if (n && m) { // check if both values are true (non-zero) // do something here } Shift operators Operator Operation Example Result << Bitwise left shift a << b Shift a by b bits to the left >> Bitwise right shift a >> b Shift a by b bits to the right Note Bits that are shifted out are lost (in both cases) For shift left, 0's are shifted in (zero fill) Code example // Logical shift right (zero fill) // If a is unsigned: unsigned char a; a = 250; // a = 0b11111010 = 250 b = a >> 2; // b = 0b00111110 = 62 // Arithmetic shift right (sign extend) // If a is signed: char a; a = -6; // a = 0b11111010 = -6 b = a >> 2; // b = 0b11111110 = -2 Power of 2 integer divide vs. shift right Generally, it is more efficient to use a shift right instead of dividing by a power of 2. This means that b = a / 2^n is equal to b = a >> n . This trick works for integer and fixed point values. Memory addressing/member access Member access operators allow access to the members of their operands. Operator Operation Example Result [] Array subscript a[b] access the b th element of array a * Pointer dereference *a The object or function a points to & Address of &a Pointer to a . Member access (struct/union) a.b The member b of struct or union a -> Member access through pointer a->b The member b of struct or union pointed to by a Note This will become important when talking about arrays, pointers, structs, and unions later. Other operators Operator Operation Example Result (...) Function call f(...) Calls the function f(), with specified arguments , Comma operator a, b Evaluates a then b , else result is value of b (type) Type cast (type)a Casts the type of a to type ? : Conditional operator a ? b : c The value of b if a is true, else value of c sizeof Sizeof operator sizeof a The size in bytes of a The conditional operator (test_expression) ? do_if_true : do_if_false; Code example int a = 3, b = 4, c; (a % 2 != 0) ? printf(\"%d is odd\\n\", a) : printf(\"%d is even\\n\", a); c = (a % 2 != 0) ? a : b; // conditionally assigns a value to c Explicit type cast operator You can use the cast operator (type) to cast a variable: Code example int a = 10; float b; b = (float)a / 4; // b is 2.5, because float/int = float Operator precedence The following table lists the precedence and associativity of C operators. Operators are listed top to bottom, in descending precedence. Conflicts between operators with the same precedence are handled via the rules of associativity.

Expression Expression with precedence a \u2013 b * c a \u2013 (b * c) a + ++b a + (++b) a + ++b * c a + ((++b) * c) Note If functions are part of an expression, there is no way to tell which function is evaluated first. Associativity For two operators with the same precedence, the associativity determines the order of the evaluation of the expression. Expression Associativity Expression with precedence x / y % z Left-to-Right (x / y) % z x = y = z Right-to-Left x = (y = z) ~++x Right-to-Left ~(++x) Although these rules are always applied, it is good practice to explicitly group the elements of an expression using () .","title":"Operators"},{"location":"25.html#operators","text":"What is an operator?

Functions are self contained program segments designed to perform a specific task. They take inputs, do some computation, and produce output. Functions provide a way to modularize code and make it easier to maintain. Also, functions promote code reuse. Note All C programs have one (at least the main() function is required) or more functions Functions can accept parameters from the code that calls them Functions usually return a single value Functions help to organize a program into logical, manageable segments Syntax type identifier (type1 arg1, type2 arg2, ..., typen argn) { declarations // body statements // body return expression; // body } Where: - type is the data type of the return expression. - identifier is the name of the function. - type1 arg1, type2 arg2, ..., typen argn is the parameter list which is optional. - expression is the (optional) return value. - the body is also optional. Return data type A function's type must match the type of data in the return expression A function may have multiple return statements (of the same type), but only one will be executed The function type is void if the return statement has no expression or is not present at all. This is also known as a procedure function, since nothing is returned. Functions can return any type except arrays and functions. We can get around this limitation by returning a pointer to an array or a pointer to a function. Parameters A function's parameters are declared just like ordinary variables, but in a comma separated list inside the parentheses The parameter names are only valid inside the function (local to the function) The list may mix different data types Parameters of the same type must be declared separately (as separation using commas will not work here) If no parameters are required, use the keyword void in place of the parameter list when defining the function How to call a function Code example foo (); // no parameters, no return value x = foo (); // no parameters, but with a return value foo (n, m); // with parameters, but no return value x = foo (n, m); // with parameters and with a return value Function prototypes Just like a variable, a function must be declared before it may be used. This declaration must occur before main() or any other function that uses it. The declaration may have two forms: - The entire function definition - Just a function prototype \u2013 the function definition itself may then be placed anywhere in the program Code example 1 In this example, the function is declared and defined before it is used in main() . int n = 5, m = 10, res; int minimum (int a, int b) { return ((a <= b) ? a : b); } int main (void) { res = minimum (n, m); printf(\"The minimum is %d\\n\", res); } Code example 2 In this example, the function is declared before it is used in main() , but only defined after it is used in main() . int n = 5, m = 10, res; int minimum (int a, int b); int main (void) { res = minimum (n, m); printf(\"The minimum is %d\\n\", res); } int minimum (int a, int b) { return ((a <= b) ? a : b); } Function prototype formats Code example // Function prototype 1: int minimum (int x, int y); // exact copy of the function header // Function prototype 2: int minimum (int, int); // contains only the parameter data types Passing parameters by value Parameters are passed to a function by value . These values are copied into the local parameter variables. This means, that the original variable that is passed to a function cannot be modified by the function, since only a copy of its value was passed. Code example int n = 5, m = 10, res; int minimum (int a, int b); int main (void) { res = minimum (n, m); // the value of n is copied into a // the value of m is copied into b printf(\"The minimum is %d\\n\", res); } int minimum (int a, int b) { return ((a <= b) ? a : b); } Functions and scope Scope of parameters A function's parameters are local to the function and have no meaning outside the function itself. Parameter names may have the same identifier as a variable declared outside the function, but the parameter names will take precedence inside the function. Code example // The following n's are not the same: int n; int absolute (int n); Scope of variables inside a function Variables that are declared inside a function are local to the function itself. Code example void my_func (int n) { int m; .. m -= n; // n refers to the function paramter // while me refers to the locally declared variable } Note Variables that are declared within a function block are not accessible outside the function. Any access to a local variable outside the function will generate an error. Global versus local variables Global variables can be seen by everybody, while local variables can only be seen locally. Code example int n = 5; // can be seen by everybody int foo (int m); // foo's local paramter is m int foo (int m) { // foo cannot see main's local variable i int p = 3; // foo's local variable is p return (n - m * p); // foo can see gloabal variable n } int main (void) { // main cannot see foo's paramter m nor local variable p int i = 2; // main's local variable is i n = foo (i); // main can see global variable n i = foo (n); } Overloading variable names A locally declared identifier takes precedence over a globally defined one. This enables the usage of the same parameter name in different functions. Each function will only use its own parameter. Code example int n = 5; // global variable n int foo (int n) { // foo's function parameter int p = 3; // foo's local variable is p return (n(1 - p)); // foo can not see glonbal variable n // function parameter n is used instead } void bar (int n) { // bar's function parameter // do some computation here } #define within a function Use #define 's within a function with care. Defining already defined identifiers again can lead to unexpected behavior. Code example #define a 5 void func_define (void) { #define a 7 printf (\"%d\\n\", a); } void main (void) { printf (\"%d\\n\", a); func_define(); } Running the code above will lead to the following output: 7 7 Note Remember that a #define is used by the preprocessor to do text substitution before the code is compiled.

These features basically include the scope, visibility and lifetime. They are used to trace the existence of a certain variable during the runtime of a program. Scope refers to where in a program a variable may be accessed. Lifetime refers to how long a variable will exist or retain its value. In C, four storage classes are available: - Automatic - Static - External - Register Syntax storage_class type identifier; Auto variables The default storage class for all variables declared inside a function or a block is auto . Auto variables can be only accessed within the block/function they have been declared and not outside them. To access them outside their scope, use a pointer to the very exact memory location where the variables resides. They are assigned a garbage value by default whenever they are declared. As auto is the default, the keyword auto is rarely used. Typically, auto variables are created on the stack. Code example int foo (char n, float m) { // n, m are auto variables int j, k; // j, k are auto variables } Static variables Variables declared as static preserve their value even after they are out of their scope, as they are given a permanent address in memory. They are created/initialized once when the program starts and are only destroyed when the program ends! Their scope is local to the function to which they were defined. Global static variables can be accessed anywhere in the program. By default, they are assigned the value 0 by the compiler. Code example int a; // global variable is static int main (void) { a = 23; .. } Code example main.c float foo (float f) { static float a = 3.141; .. a -= f; return a; } Note A variable declared as static inside a function retains its value between consecutive function calls. If given an initial value, a static variable is only initialized when first created \u2013 not during each function call. Extern variables The extern storage class keyword tells the compiler that the variable is defined elsewhere and will be used in the current scope. Thus, it still needs to be declared within the current scope. A variable declared as extern outside of any function is used to indicate that the variable is defined in another source file. Memory is only allocated for it when it's defined. Code example main.c extern int a; int main (void) { a = 23; .. } Code example someOtherProjectFile.c int a; int foo (void) { .. } Register variables This storage class declares register variables which have the same functionality as auto variables. The only difference is that the Arm compiler v5 tries to store these variables in a register of the Arm Cortex-M core if a free register is available. This accelerates the access to the register variables. Arm compiler v6 ignores this keyword. Scope of functions The scope of a function depends on it storage class, which can be either static or external . The scope of a function is either local to the file where it is defined - in case of a static function - or globally available to any file in a project - in case of an external function. By default, functions have a global scope within a project. The extern keyword is not required, but a function prototype in the calling file (or a header file).

Arrays are variables that can store many items of the same type stored at continuous memory locations. The items are known as elements and are identified by the array index. Arrays may contain any number of elements which must be of the same type. The array index is zero based and the size of the array (number of elements) must be specified at the array declaration. Syntax type arrayIdentifier[size]; The size refers to the number of elements and must be a constant integer. Code example int n[100]; // an array that holds 100 integer values char c[26]; // an array that holds 26 characters Arrays may be initialized when declared using a list: Syntax type arrayIdentifier[size] = {item1, ..., itemsize-1}; All items must match the type of the array.

Many books will teach you that a pointer points to something, but this is not true: A pointer is a variable that contains the memory address of another variable. As any other variable, you need to declare a pointer. Furthermore, you have to initialize a pointer before you can use it. Where are pointers used? Pointers provide a method to pass more than one piece of information into and out of a function (remember that a function can only return one value). They also provide means to pass arguments by reference to functions, rather than by value. And finally, pointers are more efficient when accessing arrays and dealing with strings. Pointer declaration You declare a pointer just like any other variable: Syntax type *name; Note type can be any C type (such as char , int , or float for example). name is the name of the pointer variable. The * makes the variable a pointer. Pointers are usually described as \"a pointer to type \" Code example int *myPointer // declares a pointer named myPointer as an integer type float *myOtherPointer // declares a pointer named myOtherPointer as a float type myPointer = &myIntVar; // assigns the memory address of myIntVar to myPointer myOtherPointer = &myFloatVar; // assigns the memory address of myFloatVar to myOtherPointer Creating pointer types with typedef Syntax typedef type *typeName; Note A pointer variable can now be declared as type typeName which is a synonym for type . The * is no longer needed since typeName explicitly identifies the variable as a pointer to type . Code example typedef int *intPointer; // Create a pointer to int type intPointer p; // Create pointer to int (without *) // Equivalent to int *p; Initialization To set a pointer to point to another variable, we use the & operator (address of), and the pointer variable is used without the dereference operator * : p = &n; This assigns the address of the variable n to the pointer p ( p now points to n ). Note p must be declared to point to the type of n (e.g. int n; int *p; ). Usage When accessing the variable pointed to by a pointer, we use the pointer with the dereference operator * : m = *p; This assigns to the variable m, the value of what p is pointing to (n from the last example). Using *p , is the same as using the variable it points to (e.g. n). In other words Code example int n, *p; // Create an integer variable and a pointer to an integer variable p = &n; // Assign the address of n to p *p = 3; // Equals to n = 3; In the pointer world: - &n is a constant pointer which represents the address of n . This address of n will never change. - p is a variable pointer to int which can be assigned the address of any int any time. - *p represents the data pointed to by p and may be used anywhere you would use n . - * is the dereference operator, also called the indirection operator. - When declaring a pointer, * is used to indicate that the variable is a pointer rather than an ordinary variable. Pointers at work Consider the following code example. How is this working in an actual design? Code example int n, m; // create two integer variables int *p; // create a pointer to an integer variable n = 0x1234; // assign 0x1234 to n m = 0xABCD; // assign 0xABCD to m p = &n; // assign the address of n to p *p = 0x4321; // assign 0x4321 to n using *p p = &m; // assign the address of m to p *p = 0xDCBA; // assign 0xDCBA to m using *p Zero-initialized RAM at program start: Assign 0x1234 to n: Assign 0xABCD to m: Assign the address of n to p: Assign 0x4321 to n using *p: Assign the address of m to p: Assign 0xDCBA to m using *p: Pointers and arrays In general, array elements occupy consecutive locations in memory. Using this knowledge, we can use pointers to access array elements. Initializing a pointer to an array Code example int a[5] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}; // integer array int *p; // Create a pointer to an integer variable To initialize the pointer to the array, you can use three different (equal) methods: Code example p = a; // works only for arrays, as the array name (here: a) is the same as the address of its first element; Arm compiler will not complain p = &a; // works for arrays and variabls alike, but in case of an array, the Arm compiler will issue a warning p = &a[0]; // safe way to point to the first element; compiler will not complain To move to the next element of the array, simply increment the pointer: Code example p++; // moves the pointer to the next element of the array p--; // moves the pointer to the previous element of the array Note Adding or subtracting a number to/from the pointer will change it by a multiple of the number of bytes of its type. Code example Increment/decrement syntax rules Use parentheses to determine what gets incremented or decremented. Modify the pointer itself // Pre-increment: *(++p); *++p; ++p; // usage example: n = *(++p); // is equivalent to: p = p + 1; n = *p; // Post-increment: *(p++); *p++; p++; // usage example: n = *p++; // is equivalent to: n = *p; p = p + 1; Modify the value pointed to by the pointer // Pre-increment: ++(*p); // usage example: n = ++(*p); // is equivalent to: *p = *p + 1; n = *p; // Post-increment: (*p)++; // usage example: n = (*p)++; // is equivalent to: n = *p; *p = *p + 1; Post-increment code example Note Remember that *(p++) is the same as *p++ ! Pre-increment code example Note Remember that *(++p) is the same as *++p ! Pointers and functions In general, functions operate on copies of the data that is passed to them. This is called pass by value. The value of the variable that is passed to a function is copied into the local variable of the function. The original variable is not changed. Passing pointers to functions Using a pointer, a function can operate on the original value instead of a copy. This is called pass by reference. Code example int n = 3; void square (int *a) { *a *= *a; } int main (void) { square(&n); } Note In the example above, the address of the variable is passed to the function and stored in the local pointer variable a. After the function call, n = 9. It was changed by the function. Functions with pointer parameters: int foo (*n) must be called in one of the following two ways. foo(&a) which passes an address to the function so that the address may be assigned to the pointer parameter: n = &a . foo(p) which passes a pointer to the function so that the pointer may be assigned to the pointer parameter n = p . As addresses of parameters are copied to local pointer variables, functions can now modify the original variables via pointers, as shown in the next example. Code example void swap_values (int *v1, int *v2) { int temp; temp = *v1; *v1 = *v2; *v2 = temp; } // main() function int main(void) { int n = 5, m = 10; int *p = &m; swap_values (&n, p); // Endless loop while(1); } Pointers and strings Until now, we have used arrays of char to work with strings. Using pointers, strings can be created and used in a more efficient way. Syntax char *name = \"string_content\"; Note Initializing a character string when it is declared is essentially the same for both a pointer and an array The NULL character \\0 is automatically appended to strings in both cases Code example char *str = \"Cortex\"; At initialization, a pointer to a string points to the first character. To access subsequent characters, add an offset to the pointer. Pointers versus arrays An entire string may be assigned to a pointer in a single step, while a character array must be assigned character by character. Also, you must explicitly add the NULL character \\0 to an array. Code example // Pointer variable char *str; str = \"Cortex\"; // Array variable char str[7]; str[0] = 'C'; str[1] = 'o'; str[2] = 'r'; str[3] = 't'; str[4] = 'e'; str[5] = 'x'; str[6] = '\\0'; Arrays of pointers An array of pointers is an array variable whose elements are all be pointers. Code example char *str[3]; // creates an array of three pointers to char str[0] = \"IN\"; str[1] = \"OUT\"; str[2] = \"TRISTATE\"; The array str[] itself is like any other array. Each element, such as str[1], is a pointers to char . Note Strings will not \u201cpack\u201d this nicely! There will be empty locations between strings as the compiler aligns the strings in memory. Initialization A pointer array element may be initialized just like its ordinary variable counterpart. Code example str[0] = &n; When using strings: Code example str[0] = \"String\"; Dereferencing To use the value pointed to by a pointer array element, just dereference it like you would an ordinary variable Code example m = *str[0]; Using *str[0] is the same as using the object it points to, such as n or the string literal \"String\" .

Structure definition Syntax struct structName { type1 memberName1; // Members are declared just ... // like odinary variables typen memberNamen; } Variable declaration There are two ways to declare a structure variable: At structure definition: Syntax struct structName { type1 memberName1; // Members are declared just ... // like odinary variables typen memberNamen; } variableName1, ..., variableNamen; Code example // structure to handle color values struct rgb { int red; int green; int blue; } color; // declare color of type rgb If the structure has already been defined: Syntax struct structName variableName1, ..., variableNamen; Code example // structure to handle color values struct rgb { int red; int green; int blue; } ... struct rgb color; // declare color of type rgb Using structure variables Syntax structVariableName.memberName; Code example // structure to handle color values struct rgb { int red; int green; int blue; } color; int main (void){ color.red = 0; // set red portion of color color.green = 145; // set green portion of color blue = 189; // set blue portion of color } Structure types Structure types can be created using a typedef . Syntax typedef struct structTag { type1 memberName1; ... typen memberNamen; } typeName; Note The structTag is optional Code example // structure type to handle color values typedef struct { int red; int green; int blue; } rgb; Declare a structure type variable If the typeName has already been defined, you can declare a variable of that type without the struct keyword: Syntax typeName variableName1, ..., variableNamen; Code example // structure type to handle color values typedef struct { int red; int green; int blue; } rgb; ... rgb color; Initialization of structure variables If typeName or structName have already been defined: Syntax typeName variableName = {const1, ..., constn}; // or struct structName variableName = {const1, ...,constn}; Code example // structure type to handle color values typedef struct { int red; int green; int blue; } rgb; ... rgb color = {0, 145, 189}; Nested structures Using the typedef structure declaration, you can nest one structure within another structure. Code example // declare struct type for a single point typedef struct { float x; float y; } point; // declare a struct type for a line with a start and end point typedef struct { point start; point end; } line; int main(void) { line l; l.start.x = 3.5; l.start.y = 8.4; l.end.x = 12.7; l.end.y = 18.5; ... } Pointers to structures There are two ways to declare a pointer to a structure. If the typeName or the structName have already been defined: Syntax typeName *pointerName; // or struct structName *pointerName; Code example // structure type to handle color values typedef struct { int red; int green; int blue; } rgb; ... rgb *pColor; Code example // structure type to handle color values struct rgb { int red; int green; int blue; } ... struct rgb *pColor; Accessing structure members using a pointer If a pointerName has already been defined: Syntax pointerName -> memberName; Note First, the pointer must be initialized to point to the address of the structure itself: pointerName = &structVariable; Code example // structure type to handle color values typedef struct { int red; int green; int blue; } rgb; ... rgb color; // rgb variable rgb *pColor; // pointer to color int main (void) { pColor = color; pColor->red = 0; // Set red using pColor pColor->green = 145; // Set green using pColor pColor->blue = 189; // Set blue using pColor } Note We will later see in an example how CMSIS uses this to access core peripherals of a Cortex-M based device. Creating arrays of structures There are two ways to create arrays of structures. If the typeName or the structName have already been defined: Syntax typeName arrayName[n]; // or struct structName arrayName[n]; Code example // structure type to handle color values typedef struct { int red; int green; int blue; } rgb; ... rgb aColor[2]; Initializing arrays of structures at declaration If the typeName or the structName have already been defined: Syntax typeName arrayName[n] = {{list1}, ..., {listn}}; // or struct structName arrayName[n] = {{list1}, ..., {listn}}; Code example // structure type to handle color values typedef struct { int red; int green; int blue; } rgb; ... rgb aColor[2] = {{0, 0, 0}, {255, 255, 255}}; Using arrays of structures If the arrayName has already been defined: Syntax arrayName[n].memberName Code example // structure type to handle color values typedef struct { int red; int green; int blue; } rgb; ... rgb aColor[2] = {{0, 0, 0}, {255, 255, 255}}; int main (void) { aColor[0].red = 0; aColor[0].green = 145; aColor[0].blue = 189; ... } Passing structures to functions Code example // structure type to handle color values typedef struct { int red; int green; int blue; } rgb; void show_rgb (rgb n) { printf(\"(%d, %d, %d)\\n\", n.reg, n.green, n.blue); } int main (void) { rgb a = {0, 145, 198}; rgb b = {0, 255, 255}; show_rgb (a); show_rgb (b); }","title":"Structures"},{"location":"70.html#structures","text":"What are structures?

Unions are similar to structures but a union\u2019s members all share the same memory location. In essence a union is a variable that is capable of holding different types of data at different times.
